# Valtio

### Proxy state made simple.

The Valtio api is minimal, flexible, unopinionated and a touch magical. Valtio proxy turns the object you pass it into a self-aware proxy, allowing fine-grained subscription and creativity in making state updates. In React, Valtio shines at render optimization. It is also compatible with Suspense and React 18. Valtio provides a vanilla javascript api as well, making it a viable option in vanilla applications or with other frameworks.

#### Installation

```bash
npm i valtio
```

#### Recipes

Valtio is unopinionated about best practices.
The community is working on recipes on wiki pages.
