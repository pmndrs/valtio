# How to reset state

In some cases, you might want to reset the state in your proxy instance to its initial values. For example, you are storing form values or some other ephemeral UI state that you want to reset. It turns out this is quite simple to do!

```js
const initialObj = {
  text: 'hello',
  arr: [1, 2, 3],
  obj: { a: 'b' },
}

const state = proxy(initialObj)

const reset = () => {
  const resetObj = _.cloneDeep(initialObj)
  Object.keys(resetObj).forEach((key) => {
    state[key] = resetObj[key]
  })
}
```

Note that we're using the [cloneDeep](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#cloneDeep) utility function from `lodash` to copy the initial object in the `reset` function. This allows Valtio to update correctly when the value of a key is an object. If you prefer `underscore` or some similar JS utility library, feel free to use that instead.

Alternatively, you can store the object in another object, which make the reset logic easier:

```js
const state = proxy({ obj: initialObj })

const reset = () => {
  state.obj = _.cloneDeep(initialObj)
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using `structuredClone()`

In 2022, there was a new global function added called `structuredClone` that is widely available in most modern browsers. While this function and `_.cloneDeep` from lodash seem to do the same thing, their implementations are quite different.

In valtio v1, `proxy` cloned the object used for inital state under the hood. Because the original object isn't used, `structuredClone` works just fine as a drop in replacement for `_.cloneDeep`.

```js
// v1
const initialObj = {...}

const state = proxy({ obj: initialObj })

const reset = () => {
  state.obj = structuredClone(initialObj)
}
```

In valtio v2, the `proxy` function [no longer clones the initial state]('/docs/guides/migrating-to-v2.mdx'). Instead, it uses the original object directly. It is not recommended that you reuse the object that you pass into the proxy function. If you use `structuredClone` that object, it will throw an error. `_.cloneDeep` won't give you an error, but it could produce unwatned results. To fix this, you can clone the intial state object that you pass to into `proxy`. You can do this with `_.cloneDeep`, `structuredClone`, or the utility function `deepClone` from `valtio/utils`. Example below.

```js
// v2
const initialObj = {...}

const state = proxy(structuredClone(initialObj))

const reset = () => {
  state.obj = structuredClone(initialObj)
}
```
