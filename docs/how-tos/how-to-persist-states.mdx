# How to persist states

## persist with localStorage

If your state is JSON serializable, it should be pretty straightforward.

```js
const state = proxy(
  JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('foo')) || {
    count: 0,
    text: 'hello',
  }
)

subscribe(state, () => {
  localStorage.setItem('foo', JSON.stringify(state))
})
```

If you have non serializable values, attach them after deserialization and exclude them for serialization.

**_[valtio-persist](https://github.com/Noitidart/valtio-persist) is a library that can help with this._**
