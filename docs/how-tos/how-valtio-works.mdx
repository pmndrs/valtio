# How valtio works

Ref: https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio/issues/171

This is to describe the high level abstraction of valtio.

## By examples

### `proxy()` by examples

```js
import { proxy, subscribe } from 'valtio'

const s1 = proxy({})
subscribe(s1, () => { console.log('s1 is changed!') })
s1.a = 1 // s1 is changed!
++s1.a // s1 is changed!
delete s1.a // s1 is changed!
s1.b = 2 // s1 is changed!
s1.b = 2 // (not changed)
s1.obj = {} // s1 is changed!
s1.obj.c = 3 // s1 is changed!
const s2 = s1.obj
subscribe(s2 () => { console.log('s2 is changed!') })
s1.obj.d = 4 // s1 is changed! and s2 is changed!
s2.d = 5 // s1 is changed! and s2 is changed!
const s3 = proxy({})
subscribe(s3 () => { console.log('s3 is changed!') })
s1.o = s3
s3.p = 'hello' // s1 is changed! and s3 is changed!
s2.q = s3
s3.p = 'hi' // s1 is changed! s2 is changed! and s3 is changed!
s1.x = s1
s1.a += 1 // s1 is changed!
```

### `snapshot()` by examples

```js
import { proxy, snapshot } from 'valtio'

const p = proxy({})
const s1 = snapshot(p) // is {} but not wrapped by a proxy
const s2 = snapshot(p)
s1 === s2 // is true because p wasn't changed
p.a = 1 // mutate the proxy
const s3 = snapshot(p) // is { a: 1 }
p.a = 1 // mutation bails out and proxy is not updated
const s4 = snapshot(p)
s3 === s4 // is still true
p.a = 2 // mutate it
const s5 = snapshot(p) // is { a: 2 }
p.a = 1 // mutate it back
const s6 = snapshot(p) // creates a new snapshot
s3 !== s6 // is true (different snapshots, even though they are deep equal)
p.obj = { b: 2 } // attaching a new object, which will be wrapped by a proxy
const s7 = snapshot(p) // is { a: 1, obj: { b: 2 } }
p.a = 2 // mutating p
const s8 = snapshot(p) // is { a: 2, obj: { b: 2 } }
s7 !== s8 // is true because a is different
s7.obj === s8.obj // is true because obj is not changed
```

### `useSnapshot()` by examples

## Unorganized Notes

### two kinds of proxies

valtio has two kinds of proxies, for write and read. We intentionally separate them for hooks and concurrent react.

`proxy()` creates a proxy object to detect mutation, "proxy for write"
`snapshot()` creates an immutable object from the proxy object
`useSnapshot()` wraps the snapshot object again with another proxy (with `proxy-compare`) to detect property access, "proxy for read"

### snapshot creation is optimized

```js
const state = proxy({ a: { aa: 1 }, b: { bb: 2 } })
const snap1 = snapshot(state)
console.log(snap1) // ---> { a: { aa: 1 }, b: { bb: 2 } }
++state.a.aa
const snap2 = snapshot(state)
console.log(snap2) // ---> { a: { aa: 2 }, b: { bb: 2 } }
snap1.b === snap2.b // this is `true`, it doesn't create a new snapshot because no properties are changed.
```

### Some notes about valtio implementation in deep

valtio's proxy has only one goal: create an immutable snapshot object

some design principles:

1. snapshot is created on demand
2. changes are tracked only with version number
3. subscription is used for notifying update (version)
4. version number is hidden as implementation detail
5. proxies are basically used only for version and subscription
6. snapshot creation is optimized with version number

some notes about the implementation:

1. proxy can be nested (created at the initialization)
2. proxy can have circular structure (globalVersion to detect it)

some notes about promise handling:

1. proxy can have a promise but does nothing
2. when creating a snapshot, it will store the resolved value
3. if it's not resolved, a special object will throw a promise/error
