# How to organize actions

Valtio is unopinionated about organizing actions.
Here's some recipes to show various patterns are possible.

## Action functions defined in module

**_Note_ This way is preferred as it is better for code splitting.**

```js
import { proxy } from 'valtio'

export const state = proxy({
  count: 0,
  name: 'foo',
})

export const inc = () => {
  ++state.count
}

export const setName = (name) => {
  state.name = name
}
```

## Action object defined in module

```js
import { proxy } from 'valtio'

export const state = proxy({
  count: 0,
  name: 'foo',
})

export const actions = {
  inc: () => {
    ++state.count
  },
  setName: (name) => {
    state.name = name
  },
}
```

## Action methods defined in state

```js
export const state = proxy({
  count: 0,
  name: 'foo',
  inc: () => {
    ++state.count
  },
  setName: (name) => {
    state.name = name
  },
})
```

## Action methods using `this`

```js
export const state = proxy({
  count: 0,
  name: 'foo',
  inc() {
    ++this.count
  },
  setName(name) {
    this.name = name
  },
})
```

## Using class

```js
class State {
  count = 0
  name = 'foo'
  inc() {
    ++this.count
  }
  setName(name) {
    this.name = name
  }
}

export const state = proxy(new State())
```
