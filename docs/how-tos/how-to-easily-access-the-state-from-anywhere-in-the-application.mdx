# How to easily access the state from anywhere in the application

When working with large applications organizing code in separate files and directories is the go-to way and the Valtio **state** is no exception. In some ways you may want to put the state object in its own file. After being separated in its own file we need a way to access it easily from anywhere in our application.

## Access the state using Path Aliases

Imagine that the state is put in `/src/state.js` and you are working with a file in `/src/really/deep/nested/file/myfile.js` the importing of the state will be something like this:
`import state from '../../../../state';` which can cause too much brain calculation specially if it is used in different places inside the application.

A solution to that is using **Path Aliases** which maps path to a simpler string and the import will look like something similar to that throughout the whole application:

`import { state } from '@state';`

## Using JS Config and Babel Config

1. Create the file `/src/state` and put the Valtio **state** into it:

```js
import { proxy, useSnapshot, subscribe } from 'valtio'
const state = proxy({
  foos: [],
  bar: { ... },
  boo: false
})
export { state, useSnapshot, subscribe }
```

2. Create the file `/jsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@state/*": ["./state/*"],
      "@mypath/*": ["./my/deep/path*"],
      "@anotherpath/*": ["./my/another/deep/path*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

3. Add the **Module Resolver** plugin the plugins in your `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // The other existing plugins
    [
      'module-resolver',
      {
        root: ['./src'],
        extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '.json', '.svg', '.png'],
        alias: {
          '@state': './src/state',
        },
      },
    ],
    // ...
  ],
}
```

4. Install the the Babel Plugin Module Resolver:

- Using NPM: `npm install babel-plugin-module-resolver`
- Using Yarn: `yarn add babel-plugin-module-resolver`

5. Restart the application server
   <br />
   That's it you will now be able to do `import {
     (state, useSnapshot, subscribe)
   } from '@state';` from anywhere inside your application.

## Using a third party library

You can use a third party library to create aliases and achieve the same result.

Example of libraries:

- [Module Alias](https://www.npmjs.com/package/module-alias)
