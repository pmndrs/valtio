# Some gotchas

## `useSnapshot(state)` without property access will always trigger re-render

https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio/issues/209#issuecomment-896859395

Suppose we have this state (or store).

```js
const state = proxy({
  obj: {
    count: 0,
    text: 'hello',
  },
})
```

If using the snapshot with accessing count,

```js
const snap = useSnapshot(state)
snap.obj.count
```

it will re-render only if `count` changes.

If the property access is obj,

```js
const snap = useSnapshot(state)
snap.obj
```

then, it will re-render if `obj` changes. This includes `count` changes and `text` changes.

Now, we can subscribe to the portion of the state.

```js
const snapObj = useSnapshot(state.obj)
snapObj
```

This is technically same as the previous one. It doesn't touch the property of `snapObj`, so it will re-render if `obj` changes.

In summary, if a snapshot object (nested or not) is not accessed with any properties, it assumes the entire object is accessed, so any change inside the object will trigger re-render.

## Using `React.memo` with object props may result in unexpected behavior

The `snap` variable returned by `useSnapshot(state)` is tracked for render optimization.
If you pass the `snap` or some objects in `snap` to a component with `React.memo`,
it may not work as expected because `React.memo` can skip touching object properties.

Side note: [react-tracked](https://react-tracked.js.org) has a special `memo` exported as a workaround.

We have some options:

a. Do not use `React.memo`.

b. Do not pass objects to components with `React.memo` (pass primitive values instead).

c. Pass in the proxy of that element, and then `useSnapshot` on that proxy.

### Example of (b)

```jsx
const ChildComponent = React.memo(
  ({
    title, // string or any primitive values are fine.
    description, // string or any primitive values are fine.
    // obj, // objects should be avoided.
  }) => (
    <div>
      {title} - {description}
    </div>
  )
)

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const snap = useSnapshot(state)
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent
        title={snap.obj.title}
        description={snap.obj.description}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Example of (c)

```jsx
const state = proxy({
  objects: [
    { id: 1, label: 'foo' },
    { id: 2, label: 'bar' },
  ],
})

const ObjectList = React.memo(() => {
  const stateSnap = useSnapshot(state)

  return stateSnap.objects.map((object, index) => (
    <Object key={object.id} objectProxy={state.objects[index]} />
  ))
})

const Object = React.memo(({ objectProxy }) => {
  const objectSnap = useSnapshot(objectProxy)

  return objectSnap.bar
})
```

## When to use `state` and when to use `snap` in functional components

- snap should be used in render function, every other cases state.
- callback functions are not in the render body and therefore state must be used.

```javascript
const Component = () => {
  // this is in render body
  const handleClick = () => {
    // this is NOT in render body
  }
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>button</button>
}
```

- deps in useEffect should be used extracting primitive values from snap. For example: `const { num, string, bool } = snap.watchObj`.
- changing a state value based on other state values (without involving values like props in a component), should preferably done outside react.

```javascript
subscribe(state.subscribeData, async () => {
  state.results = await load(state.someData)
})
```
