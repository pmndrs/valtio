# How to split and compose states

## You can split states

Creating a state with nested object.

```js
const state = proxy({
  obj1: { a: 1 },
  obj2: { b: 2 },
})
```

You can then split the state into pieces. They are both proxies.

```js
const obj1State = state.obj1
const ojb2State = state.obj2
```

## You can combine states

You can create states and then combine them.

```js
const obj1State = proxy({ a: 1 })
const obj2State = proxy({ a: 2 })

const state = proxy({
  obj1: obj1State,
  obj2: obj2State,
})
```

This works equivalently to the previous example.

## You can create circular states

While there would be less use cases, you could create a circular structure.

```js
const state = proxy({
  obj: { foo: 3 },
})

state.obj.bar = state.obj // ðŸ¤¯
```
