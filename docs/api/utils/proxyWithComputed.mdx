# proxyWithComputed

#### add a computation to a proxy

You can define own computed properties within a proxy.
By combining with a memoization library such as
[proxy-memoize](https://github.com/dai-shi/proxy-memoize),
optimizing function calls is possible.

Be careful not to overuse `proxy-memoize`
because `proxy-memoize` and `useSnapshot` do similar optimization
and double optimization may lead to less performance.

```js
import { memoize } from 'proxy-memoize'
import { proxyWithComputed } from 'valtio/utils'

const state = proxyWithComputed(
  {
    count: 1,
  },
  {
    doubled: memoize((snap) => snap.count * 2),
  }
)

// Computed values accept custom setters too:
const state2 = proxyWithComputed(
  {
    firstName: 'Alec',
    lastName: 'Baldwin',
  },
  {
    fullName: {
      get: memoize((snap) => snap.firstName + ' ' + snap.lastName),
      set: (state, newValue) => {
        ;[state.firstName, state.lastName] = newValue.split(' ')
      },
    },
  }
)

// if you want a computed value to derive from another computed, you must declare the dependency first:
const state = proxyWithComputed(
  {
    count: 1,
  },
  {
    doubled: memoize((snap) => snap.count * 2),
    quadrupled: memoize((snap) => snap.doubled * 2),
  }
)
```

The last use case fails to infer types in TypeScript
[#192](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio/issues/192).
