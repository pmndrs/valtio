# derive

#### create a new proxy derived from others

You can subscribe to some proxies using `get` to create snapshots used to compute new values.

```js
import { derive } from 'valtio/utils'

// create a base proxy
const state = proxy({
  count: 1,
})

// create a derived proxy
const derived = derive({
  doubled: (get) => get(state).count * 2,
})

// alternatively, attach derived properties to an existing proxy
derive(
  {
    tripled: (get) => get(state).count * 3,
  },
  {
    proxy: state,
  }
)
```

# underive

#### stop evaluating

In some cases you may want to unsubscribe after deriving a proxy. To do so, use the `underive` util. You may also pass keys to indicate which properties you want to unsubscribe. If you specify `delete` option, it will delete the properties
and you can attach new derived properties.

```js
import { derive, underive } from 'valtio/utils'
const state = proxy({
  count: 1,
})

const derivedState = derive({
  doubled: (get) => get(state).count * 2,
})

underive(derivedState)
```
