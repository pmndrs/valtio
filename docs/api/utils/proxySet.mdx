# `proxySet`

## Reasoning

Native `Sets` store their data in internal slots which are not observable. This means that `valtio` cannot track changes to the data inside of a native `Set`. `proxySet` is a utility that allows you to create a proxy that mimics the behavior of a `Set` while still allowing valtio to track changes to the data.

## When to use `proxySet`

`proxySet` is useful when you need the functionality of a `Set` but still want to track changes to the data. `proxySet` can be useful if you're wanting to store unique values or if you want to perform mathematical `Set` operations on the data, such as union, intersection, or difference. `proxySet` supports all of the new methods introduced to `Set`:

- `intersection`
- `isDisjointFrom`
- `isSubsetOf`
- `isSupersetOf`
- `symmetricDifference`
- `union`

You can see a full list of the methods supported by `proxySet` in the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set).

If your data can be represented as a simple array or object, and you have no need for the additional functionality provided by `proxySet`, you should use `proxy` with a simple array or object instead. It is more performant and easier to use.

## Use a js `Set` with Valtio

This utility creates a proxy which mimics the native `Set` behavior. The API is the same as the native `Set` API.

```js
import { proxySet } from 'valtio/utils'

const state = proxySet([1, 2, 3])

state.add(4)
state.delete(1)
state.forEach((v) => console.log(v)) // --->  2,3,4
```

## Nesting

It can be used inside a `proxy` as well.

```js
import { proxySet } from 'valtio/utils'

const state = proxy({
  count: 1,
  set: proxySet(),
})
```
