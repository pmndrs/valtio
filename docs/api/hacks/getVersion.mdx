# getVersion

In Valtio, updates to proxied objects are tracked internally with a version number.

Every mutation to a proxy increases a global version number, and assigns the just mutated proxy, and any parent proxies (which automatically subscribe to their child proxies), to the latest version number.

This is how `snapshot` knows whether a new snapshot is necessary: has my proxy's version number changed since the last snapshot?

Given its importance to valtio's internal behavior, the `getVersion` helper can be used to check if a proxied object has been updated, but this is not typically useful or recommended to use in application code because `snapshot` and `useSnapshot` already handle version tracking internally.

```js
getVersion(proxyObject)
```
