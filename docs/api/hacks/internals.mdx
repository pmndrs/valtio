Valtio exposes some internal capabilities.
This isn't for app developers. Use it at your own risk.

# unstable_getInternalStates

This function exposes the internal states. Modifying such states may result in wrong behaviors. You need to understand the [source code](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio/blob/main/src/vanilla.ts) thoroughly to use it.

# unstable_replaceInternalFunction

This function exposes a way to replace some internal functions. It can easily break things. You need to understand the [source code](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio/blob/main/src/vanilla.ts) thoroughly to use it.
