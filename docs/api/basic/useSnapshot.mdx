# useSnapshot

Create a local snapshot that catches changes. This hook actually returns a wrapped snapshot in a proxy for
render optimization instead of a plain object, which is what <a href="/docs/api/advanced/snapshot">`snapshot()`</a> returns.

#### Rule of thumb: read from snapshots in render function, otherwise use the source.

The component will only re-render when the parts of the state you access have changed; it is render-optimized.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const snap = useSnapshot(state)
  return (
    <div>
      {snap.count}
      <button onClick={() => ++state.count}>+1</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Read only what you need

Every object inside your proxy also becomes a proxy (if you don't use <a href="/docs/advanced/ref">`ref()`</a>). So you can also use them to create
a local snapshot.

```jsx
function ProfileName() {
  const snap = useSnapshot(state.profile)
  return <div>{snap.name}</div>
}
```

#### Gotchas

Beware of replacing the child proxy with something else, breaking your snapshot. You can see
here what happens with the original proxy when you replace the child proxy.

```js
console.log(state)
{
  profile: {
    name: 'valtio'
  }
}
childState = state.profile
console.log(childState)
{
  name: 'valtio'
}
state.profile.name = 'react'
console.log(childState)
{
  name: 'react'
}
state.profile = { name: 'new name' }
console.log(childState)
{
  name: 'react'
}
console.log(state)
{
  profile: {
    name: 'new name'
  }
}
```

`useSnapshot()` depends on the original reference of the child proxy so if you replace it with a new one, the component
that is subscribed to the old proxy won't receive new updates because it is still subscribed to the old one.

In this case, we recommend one of the approaches below. In neither example do you need to worry about re-renders because it is render-optimized.

```jsx
const snap = useSnapshot(state)

return <div>{snap.profile.name}</div>
```

```jsx
const { profile } = useSnapshot(state)

return <div>{profile.name}</div>
```

#### Dev Mode Debug Values

In dev mode, `useSnapshot` uses React's `useDebugValue` to output a list of fields that were accessed during rendering, i.e. which specific fields will trigger re-render when the tracking proxy changes.

There are two disclaimers to the debug value:

1. Due to the way `useSnapshot` uses a proxy to recorded accesses _after_ `useSnapshot` has returned, the fields listed in `useDebugValue` are technically from the _previous_ render.
2. Object getter and class getter calls are not included in the `useDebugValue` output, but don't worry, they are actually correctly tracked internally and correctly trigger re-renders when changed.
