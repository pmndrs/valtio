# `snapshot`

`snapshot` takes a proxy and returns an immutable object, unwrapped from the proxy.

Immutability is achieved by _efficiently_ deep copying & freezing the object (see the [Copy on Write](#copy-on-write) section for details).

Briefly, in sequential `snapshot` calls, when the values in the proxy have not changed, the previous snapshot's object reference is returned. This allows for shallow comparison in render functions, preventing spurious renders.

Snapshots also throw promises, making them work with React Suspense.

```js
import { proxy, snapshot } from 'valtio'

const store = proxy({ name: 'Mika' })
const snap1 = snapshot(store) // an efficient copy of the current store values, unproxied
const snap2 = snapshot(store)
console.log(snap1 === snap2) // true, no need to re-render

store.name = 'Hanna'
const snap3 = snapshot(store)
console.log(snap1 === snap3) // false, should re-render
```

## Copy on Write

Even though snapshots are a deep copy of the entire state, they use a lazy copy-on-write mechanism for updates, so in practice they are quick to maintain.

For example, if we have a nested object of:

```js
const author = proxy({
  firstName: 'f',
  lastName: 'l',
  books: [{ title: 't1' }, { title: 't2' }],
})

const s1 = snapshot(author)
```

The first `snapshot` call creates four new instances:

- one for the author,
- one for the books array, and
- two for the book objects.

When we mutate the 2nd book, and take a new `snapshot`:

```js
author.books[1].title = 't2b'
const s2 = snapshot(author)
```

Then `s2` will have a new copy of the 2nd book, but reuse the existing snapshot of the unchanged 1st book.

```js
console.log(s1 === s2) // false
console.log(s1.books === s2.books) // false
console.log(s1.books[0] === s2.books[0]) // true
console.log(s1.books[1] === s2.books[1]) // false
```

Even though this example only reused one of the four existing snapshot instances, it shows that the cost of maintaining snapshots is based on the _depth_ of your state tree (which is typically low, like author to book to book reviews is three levels), and not the _breadth_ (1000s of books).

## Classes

Snapshots maintain the original objects' prototypes, so methods and getters work, and correctly evaluate against the snapshot's frozen state.

```js
import { proxy, snapshot } from 'valtio'

class Author {
  firstName = 'f'
  lastName = 'l'
  fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
}

const state = proxy(new Author())
const snap = snapshot(state)

// the snapshot has the Author prototype
console.log(snap instanceof Author) // true

state.firstName = 'f2'

// Invocations use the snapshot's state, e.g. this is still 'f' because
// inside `fullName`, `this` will be the frozen snapshot instance and not
// the mutable state proxy
console.log(snap.fullName()) // 'f l'
```

Note that the results of getters and methods are not cached, and are re-evaluated on every call.

This should be fine, because the expectation is that they execute very quickly (faster than the overhead of caching them would be worth) and are also deterministic, so the return value is based only on the already-frozen snapshot state.

## Vanilla JavaScript

In VanillaJS, `snapshot` is not necessary to access proxied object values, inside or outside of subscribe. However, it is useful, for example, to keep a serializable list of unproxied objects or check if objects have changed. It also resolves promises.
