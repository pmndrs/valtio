# subscribe

#### Subscribe from anywhere

You can access state outside your components and subscribe to changes.

```jsx
import { subscribe } from 'valtio'

const state = proxy({ count: 0 })

// Subscribe to all changes to the state proxy (and its child proxies)
const unsubscribe = subscribe(state, () =>
  console.log('state has changed to', state)
)
// Unsubscribe by calling the result
unsubscribe()
```

You can also subscribe to a portion of state.

```jsx
const state = proxy({ obj: { foo: 'bar' }, arr: ['hello'] })

subscribe(state.obj, () => console.log('state.obj has changed to', state.obj))
state.obj.foo = 'baz'
subscribe(state.arr, () => console.log('state.arr has changed to', state.arr))
state.arr.push('world')
```

#### no usage tracking

`subscribe` currently does not implement the fine-grained usage tracking of `useSnapshot`, so the callback will rerun anytime the subscribed proxy (or one of its child proxy) has any fields mutated, regardless of the fields accessed within the `callback`'s code.

Basically, valtio's subscriptions are fired on each new version of a proxy, which aligns to exactly when new `snapshot`s need to be taken, which is separate from whether specific views on a given snapshot need to re-render.
