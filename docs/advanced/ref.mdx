# ref

#### A ref allows unproxied state in a Valtio proxy

A `ref` is useful in the rare instances you to nest an object in a `proxy` that is not wrapped in an inner proxy and, therefore, is not tracked.

```js
const store = proxy({
    users: [
        { id: 1, name: 'Juho', uploads: ref([]) },
    ]
  })
})
```

Once an object is wrapped in a ref, it should be mutated without resetting the object or rewrapping in a new ref. 

```js
// do mutate
store.users[0].uploads.push({ id: 1, name: 'Juho' })
// do reset
store.users[0].uploads.splice(0)

// don't
store.users[0].uploads = []
```

A ref should also not be used as the only state in a proxy, making the proxy usage pointless.
