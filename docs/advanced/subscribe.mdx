# subscribe

#### Subscribe from anywhere

You can access state outside of your components and subscribe to changes.

```jsx
import { subscribe } from 'valtio'

// Subscribe to all state changes
const unsubscribe = subscribe(state, () =>
  console.log('state has changed to', state)
)
// Unsubscribe by calling the result
unsubscribe()
```

You can also subscribe to a portion of state.

```jsx
const state = proxy({ obj: { foo: 'bar' }, arr: ['hello'] })

subscribe(state.obj, () => console.log('state.obj has changed to', state.obj))
state.obj.foo = 'baz'
subscribe(state.arr, () => console.log('state.arr has changed to', state.arr))
state.arr.push('world')
```
