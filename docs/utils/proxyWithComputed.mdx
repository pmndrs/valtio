# proxyWithComputed

#### `proxyWithComputed` util

You can have computed values with dependency tracking with property access.
Dependency tracking in `proxyWithComputed` conflicts with the work in `useSnapshot`.
React users should prefer using `derive`.
`proxyWithComputed` works well for some edge cases and for vanilla-js users.

```js
import { proxyWithComputed } from 'valtio/utils'

const state = proxyWithComputed(
  {
    count: 1,
  },
  {
    doubled: (snap) => snap.count * 2,
  }
)

// Computed values accept custom setters too:
const state2 = proxyWithComputed(
  {
    firstName: 'Alec',
    lastName: 'Baldwin',
  },
  {
    fullName: {
      get: (snap) => snap.firstName + ' ' + snap.lastName,
      set: (state, newValue) => {
        ;[state.firstName, state.lastName] = newValue.split(' ')
      },
    },
  }
)

// if you want a computed value to derive from another computed, you must declare the dependency first:
const state = proxyWithComputed(
  {
    count: 1,
  },
  {
    doubled: (snap) => snap.count * 2,
    quadrupled: (snap) => snap.doubled * 2,
  }
)
```
