# subscribeKey

To subscribe to a primitive value of state, consider `subscribeKey` in utils.

```jsx
import { subscribeKey } from 'valtio/utils'

const state = proxy({ count: 0, text: 'hello' })
subscribeKey(state, 'count', (v) =>
  console.log('state.count has changed to', v)
)
```

There is another util `watch` which might be convenient in some cases.

```jsx
import { watch } from 'valtio/utils'

const state = proxy({ count: 0 })
const stop = watch((get) => {
  console.log('state has changed to', get(state)) // auto-subscribe on use
})
```
