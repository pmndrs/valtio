# Computed Properties

In Valtio you can use object & class getters and setters to create computed properties.

⚠️ Note: Getters in JavaScript are a more advanced feature of the language, so Valtio recommends using them with caution. That said, if you are a more advanced JavaScript programmer, they should work as you expect; see the "Note about using `this`" section below.

## Simple object getter

```js
const state = proxy({
  count: 1,
  get doubled() {
    // We recommend `state.count` for clarity to beginners, but `this.count` works too
    return state.count * 2
  },
})
console.log(state.doubled) // 2

// Getter calls on the snapshot work as expected
const snap = snapshot(state)
console.log(snap.doubled) // 2

// When count changes in the state proxy
state.count = 10
// Then snapshot's computed property does not change
console.log(snap.doubled) // 2
```

When you call `state.doubled` on the `state` proxy, it is not cached, and will be re-calculated on every call (if you must cache this result, see the section below on `proxy-memoize`).

However, when you make a snapshot, calls to `snap.doubled` are effectively cached, because the value of an object getter is copied during the snapshot process.

## Object getter and setter

Setters are also supported:

```js
const state = proxy({
  count: 1,
  get doubled() {
    return state.count * 2
  },
  set doubled(newValue) {
    state.count = newValue / 2
  },
})

// Setter calls on the state work as expected
state.doubled = 4
console.log(state.count) // 2

// Getter calls on the snapshot work as expected
const snap = snapshot(state)
console.log(snap.doubled) // 4

// And setter calls on the snapshot fail as expected
// compile error: Cannot assign to 'doubled' because it is a read-only property.
// runtime error: TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'doubled' of object '#<Object>'
snap.doubled = 2
```

As with getters, setter calls within `set doubled` (i.e. `this.count = newValue / 2`) are themselves invoked against the `state` proxy, so the new `count` value will be correctly updated (and subscribers/snapshots notified of the new change).

If you make a snapshot, all properties become readonly, so `snap.doubled = 2` will be a compile error, and will also fail at runtime because `snapshot` objects are frozen.

## Class getters and setters

Class getters and setters work effectively like object getters and setters:

```js
class Counter {
  count = 1
  get doubled() {
    return this.count * 2
  }
  set doubled(newValue) {
    this.count = newValue / 2
  }
}

const state = proxy(new Counter())
const snap = snapshot(state)

// Changing the state works as expected
state.doubled = 4
console.log(state.count) // 2
// And the snapshot value doesn't change
console.log(snap.doubled) // 2
```

Similar to object getters, class getters on the `state` proxy are not cached.

However, unlike object getters, class getters on the `snapshot` object are not cached, and are re-evaulated on every access to `snap.doubled`. As mentioned in the `snapshot` docs, this should be fine because the expectation is that getters are as cheap to evaluate as they would be to cache.

Also unlike object setters on snapshots (which immediately fail at runtime when called), class setters on snapshots will technically start evaluating, but any mutations they do internally (i.e. `this.count = newValue / 2`) will then fail at runtime because `this` will be a snapshot instance and the snapshots are frozen by `Object.freeze`.

## State usage tracking with `proxy-memoize`

If you need to cache getter results even for the `state` proxy itself, you can use Valtio's sister project [proxy-memoize](https://github.com/dai-shi/proxy-memoize).

`proxy-memoize` uses a similar usage-based tracking approach as Valtio's `snapshot` function, so it will only re-calculate the getter if fields accessed by the getter logic have actually changed.

```js
import { memoize } from 'proxy-memoize'

const memoizedDoubled = memoize((snap) => snap.count * 2)

const state = proxy({
  count: 1,
  text: 'hello',
  get doubled() {
    return memoizedDoubled(snapshot(state))
  },
})
```

With this implementation, when `text` property changes (but `count` has not), the memoized function won't be re-executed.

## Note about using `this`

You can use `this` inside of getters and setters, however you should be familiar with how JS `this` works: basically that `this` is whatever object you invoked the call against.

So if you call `state.doubled`, then `this` will be the `state` proxy.

And if you call `snap.doubled`, then `this` will be the snapshot object (except for object getters & setters, where the current value is copied during the snapshot process, so object getters & setters are never invoked on snapshots).

Despite this nuance, you should be able to use `this` as you would expect, and things will "just work".
