# Computed Properties

Valtio itself doesn't provide a functionality for computed properties,
but you can emulate it with object getters and setters.

⚠️ Note: This is a very advanced usage.

## Simple getter

```js
const state = proxy({
  count: 1,
  get doubled() {
    return state.count * 2
  },
})
```

## Getter and setter

```js
const state = proxy({
  count: 1,
  get doubled() {
    return state.count * 2
  },
  set doubled(newValue) {
    state.count = newValue / 2
  },
})
```

## State usage tracking with `proxy-memoize`

State usage tracking allows to optimize invoking functions.
You need to install [proxy-memoize](https://github.com/dai-shi/proxy-memoize).

```js
import { memoize } from 'proxy-memoize'

const memoizedDoubled = memoize((snap) => snap.count * 2)

const state = proxy({
  count: 1,
  text: 'hello',
  get doubled(): { return memoizedDoubled(snapshot(state)) },
})
```

In this case, even if the `text` property changes, the memoized function won't be re-executed.

## Note about using `this`

You can use `this` instead of `state` in object getters and setters.
You should be familiar with how JS `this` works,
as `this` can point to proxy state or snapshot object depending on usage.
